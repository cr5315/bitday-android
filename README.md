BitDay for Android
==============

BitDay for Android uses the BitDay wallpapers created by BloodyMarvellous on reddit and changes your devices wallpaper as the day goes on.

The app will be uploaded to the Google Play Store as a free app upon completion.

For beta builds, [visit this reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitday/comments/1txjir/bitday_for_android/).

##TODO
***
* Allow users to change what times the wallpaper changes
* UI cleaning
